The Pokémon franchise has long been a beloved staple in gaming, captivating audiences for decades. Its popularity soared to unprecedented heights in 2016 with the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality mobile game that garnered millions of players globally. By leveraging location-based services, the game introduced in-game features like “PokéStops” and “Gyms,” raising interesting questions about their potential influence on foot traffic around nearby local businesses.

This study investigates whether the presence of PokéStops has significantly increased customer traffic to nearby restaurants, as measured by the frequency of Yelp check-ins. To explore this, the study analyzed trends in Yelp check-ins over time, comparing restaurants located near PokéStops to those farther away. Using heat maps and difference-in-difference analyses, the findings revealed a positive, albeit statistically insignificant, increase in restaurant check-ins near PokéStops. These results suggest that while there may be a relationship, a larger dataset may be required to uncover statistically significant effects and strengthen the analysis.
